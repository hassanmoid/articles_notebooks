# articles_notebooks
This repo consists of supporting jupyter notebooks for medium article series "starting your data science journey"

I think about data science as consisting of multiple skill sets, and I will cover these skill sets one by one in a series of articles. I review each of these points in a series of articles to follow this one:
1. Introduction to data science programming
2. Introduction to data through statistics.
3. Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
4. Problem solving on Kaggle.
